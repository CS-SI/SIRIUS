Sirius has willingly been developped by CS as an Open Source software. As so, we believe this documentation shall not only explain how to use it, but also explain
the algorithms behind it. It should be noticed the used of the word 'algorithms' instead of 'theory' here. We believe that the theory can merely be found on the 
internet with high quality courses and documentations, and so will only sparsely point at it. However, we thought to begin with, and now know for sure, 
that the hardest part is rather knowing how to comprehend its discretization and deal with its outcomes. Hence this is what we will be focusing on in this documentation:
